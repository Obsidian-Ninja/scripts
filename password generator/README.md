## Shell Password Generator

This is a simple password generator script written in Bash. It generates a random password based on the length specified by the user. The script uses the `openssl` command to generate random characters and ensures the password is of the desired length.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository or download the `main.sh` file**.

   If you haven't already, clone the repository or download the `main.sh` script to your local machine.

2. **Make the script executable**:

   Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where `main.sh` is located. Then, run the following command to make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x main.sh

3. **In your terminal, run the script with the following command:**
   ```bash
   ./main.sh
4. **Follow the prompts:**

    * The script will ask you for the length of the password you want to generate.

    * It will then display a randomly generated password of the specified length.
